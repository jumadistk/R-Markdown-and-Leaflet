Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.


```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
rand_lng = function(n = 10) rnorm(n, 106.804, .01)
rand_lat = function(n = 10) rnorm(n, -6.22, .01)
m = leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(rand_lng(50), rand_lat(50),popup="Pizza Location")
m

```
